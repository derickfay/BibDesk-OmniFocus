# BibDesk-OmniFocus
Integration of BibDesk and OmniFocus

At the moment, this consists of two Applescripts to create new OmniFocus tasks (in the Quick Entry window) from BibDesk item, as follows:

**Name**: Author (Date) Title.

**Note**: 
x-bibdesk://cite key

  list of URLs and linked files

This approach
* allows easy maintenance of reading lists in BibDesk, with links back to the BibDesk records and their linked items (or to the record in PocketBib on iOS, which handles x-bibdesk:// URLs)
* promotes thinking of *why* -- i.e. for what project -- one is reading something
